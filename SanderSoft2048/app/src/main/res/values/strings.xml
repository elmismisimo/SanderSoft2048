    <string name="tutorial_t">How to Play</string>
    <string name="tutorial_1">2048 is a game where you have add cells of the same number, until you reach the value 2048.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_2_t">Moving Cells</string>
    <string name="tutorial_2">To move cells over the grid swipe your finger up, left, down and right.\nThe cells will move all the way to the border or stack with other cells.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_3_t">Adding</string>
    <string name="tutorial_3">When you move the cells in any direction, the cells that are in the same place and have the same number will merge in one cell with the sum value of both.\nAdd all the cells you need to reach a cell with the value 2048</string>
    <string name="tutorial_4_t">Game Over Conditions</string>
    <string name="tutorial_4">The game finishes when you reach 2048 or fill the grid with unsummable cells.\nRemember that 2048 is a logical and strategy game, thus brute force will only help you in rare occasions and wont take very far.\nGood luck!</string>
