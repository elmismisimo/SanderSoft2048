# SanderSoft2048

Ive decided to program 2048, a game created by Gabriele Cirulli. There are a lot of versions of 2048 over the world, but my version is the same as the original.

I wanted to check the challenge of doing this type of game, and it was very rewarding, and very fun! actually Ive been playing my 2048 up to 8192, but gamed over trying to acomplish the following 2048. Better pay attention hehehe.

Any way here it is, simple and plain. I hope you enjoy it.

Im going to put more work to it, more or less what I did to Mine Sweeper, and then Im going to upload it to Play Store also (I know there are millions of versions of 2048 there, but i dont mind, its just for the fun)

Enjoy!
